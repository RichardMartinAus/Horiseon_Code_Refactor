# Module01-challenge

## Week 1 challenge

In this weeks challenge we were given starter code for a fictitious clients existing site and tasked with refactoring the existing code to make the site more accessible and search engine friendly.

I started by adding a concise and descriptive title to the head section of the code. Secondly I removed as many div tags as possible with semantic HTML elements. The styling was then updated in the CSS document to reflect the new elements. While updating the CSS I also consolodated as much of the styling as possible while adding comments to make the styling a bit more streamlined. 

The biggest challenge I faced was that I wanted to add an alt value to the hero image to make it screen-reader-friendly and thus more accessible. To do so I had to create a container <section> and style the image to be responsive with object properties (as opposed to just using a div tag and styling the image using background properties).
